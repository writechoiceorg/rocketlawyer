**Example API Calls:** Include sample API calls that demonstrate the correct use of access tokens and scoped access tokens in various scenarios, such as server-to-server interactions and front-end requests. These examples will provide practical guidance for implementing authentication in your application.

**FAQs:** Address common questions that new partners may have, such as how to create tokens, when to use access tokens versus scoped access tokens, and best practices for securing API interactions.

**Proposed Location for Documentation:** The enhanced authentication documentation should be placed in a dedicated section within the Rocket Lawyer Developer Portal, under a category like **"Authentication and Security"**. This section should be easily accessible from the main API documentation categories and cross-linked with related API guides, such as those for RocketDoc and RocketSign.

This **API Authentication Guide** provides a comprehensive overview of the authentication process within the Rocket Lawyer API ecosystem. It covers the various types of tokens used, their purposes, and the steps to implement secure authentication practices. The guide is designed for developers and partners integrating Rocket Lawyer services into their applications.

### Introduction to Authentication

   - **Overview:** Authentication is crucial within Rocket Lawyer's API ecosystem to ensure secure and controlled access to services. This guide outlines how to manage access and service tokens effectively, emphasizing security and the correct usage of tokens across different scenarios.

### Glossary of Terms

   - **Access Token:** Created using a key and secret, this token is passed as a bearer token to grant access to Rocket Lawyer's APIs, primarily for server-to-server communication.
   - **Service Token:** Used to create a scoped access token, this token is designed for specific purposes, such as restricting access by a unique party identifier (UPID) or interview ID. It is commonly passed in emails (e.g., invite to sign) or to front-ends.
   - **Scoped Access Token:** Created using a key and secret, this token grants access restricted by the purpose defined in the service token. It is often used for accessing binders or specific documents associated with a UPID or interview ID.
   - **Unique Party Identifier (UPID):** A unique identifier in Rocket Lawyer's system that represents a party. UPIDs are used to manage access to interviews and documents within binders.
   - **Binder:** Acts as a folder containing an interview, document, and the associated UPIDs that determine who can access the binder's contents.
   - **App:** An account associated with a user, containing keys and secrets for accessing specific API products within Rocket Lawyer's ecosystem.
   - **System Roles:** Roles assigned to an app, determining whether it has backend or frontend access. Partners are typically provided with apps that have backend roles.
   - **API Product:** A grouping of related APIs, such as RocketDoc and RocketSign, which are part of Rocket Lawyer's API offerings.

## Getting Started with Authentication

   - **API Authorization:** Authorization to access Rocket Lawyer's APIs is managed using a key and secret. While apps can be created and requested through the developer portal, Rocket Lawyer must manually enable access. 

   - **Access Tokens vs. Scoped Access Tokens:** 

     - **Access Tokens:** Allow access to all interviews created by the app, suitable for broad server-to-server access.
     - **Scoped Access Tokens:** Restrict access to specific users or documents based on the UPID or interview ID, providing more granular control, particularly in front-end applications.

## Usage Scenarios

   - **Embedded UX Components:** Partners using embedded RocketDoc and RocketSign UX components do not need to create scoped access tokens directly. These tokens are generated by the UX component using frontend system role credentials.
   - **Building Custom Front-ends:** Partners who wish to build custom front-ends will need to create API calls from the front-end. For this purpose, a new app with a frontend system role must be created to ensure secure API interactions.

## Security Best Practices

   - **Frontend Security:** Always use scoped access tokens in front-end applications to prevent exposure of backend credentials in the browser. Never pass credentials for apps with backend system roles to the front-end.
   - **Token Handling:** Ensure tokens are securely handled, including best practices for storage and transmission, to prevent unauthorized access.
