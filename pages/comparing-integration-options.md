When integrating with RocketDocument, there are two primary options: **Embedded UX** and **Build Your Own UX**. This page compares these options and outlines the features available for each, helping you choose the best approach for your needs.
## Integration Options Overview
Here is an overview of the integration options available for embedding or customizing the Rocket Lawyer user experience within your application, catering to different levels of control and customization based on your specific needs.
- The **Embedded UX** option offers a ready-to-use interface that can be directly embedded into your application, making it ideal for those seeking a quick, out-of-the-box solution with minimal development effort. Customization is limited to modifying styles and certain functionalities within the provided components, making it best suited for partners looking for a fast and straightforward integration process.
- The **Build Your Own UX** option provides complete control over the user interface, allowing you to design a completely custom experience that integrates with Rocket Lawyer's APIs. This option offers complete freedom to tailor the user experience to specific business needs, making it ideal for partners who require a highly customized interface. It is crucial to note that you will need more resources and a team with design and development experience to create a fully customized user interface.
